#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass project was based on system desgin.  The client was DriverPass and they were required a system when customers (students) can purchase driving instructions in addition to online test in compliance with DMV.
#What did you do particularly well?
I think my diagrams where well done I believe that I was able to capture all requirements, actors and flow of the system.
#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I would probably improve on my Gantt chart.  I think I could re-organize it by adding extra columns with date detail such as start/end week and actual date end of task.
#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
For each user I linked their needs or use case needed within the system in the UML Use Case Diagram.  When designing a system is very important to consider the user's needs so that the system makes sense and it flows correctly.  For instanct in the Sequence Diagram we can see how the student would interact with the system.  We know that the student needs to create acct & login and the system needs to verify password.  
#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think in the future I would definetly use LucidChart or a similar software to desing a system.  The DriverPass project was a good hand-on project to practice system desgin with diagrams.
